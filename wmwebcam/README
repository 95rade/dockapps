wmwebcam 0.3.5 - written by Antti Takala <fragment@nic.fi>
--------------

better documentation coming later, don't panic.

this is for watching your webcam which has a video4linux driver in your
windowmakers dock..

this is actually just a edited version of vidcat (from w3cam's package)
I combined it with minirgb to open a dockapp window where to draw the
image from the webcam. some code is also taken from timecops
wmtime-minirgb demo (windowopening etcetc).

default jpeg output file is /tmp/wmwebcam.jpg and default quality is 100%,
change the default values if necessary from the source code.

also remember to check the wmwebcam.pl and edit it

problems running this app? first I was going to make this only for myself but
decided to release it anyway. don't ask help if this doesn't work on your
system, sorry =)
