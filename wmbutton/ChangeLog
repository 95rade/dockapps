CHANGE LOG:
-----------
0.7.0	Correct path for X11 libs
	  The X11 libraries are now in include/X11 folder, instead of include
	  folder. Now is possible to compile the application in new systems.
	  This patch changes the wmbutton version in the README file too.
	  Based on Christian Aichinger's patch.
	.wmbutton file renamed
	  The file .wmbutton is a hidden file, and is better to distribute
	  it as sample configuration file (sample.wmbutton).
	  Based on Christian Aichinger's patch.
	Support for global conf file
	  This patch is based in the code wrote by Christian Aichinger
	  for the Debian distribution.
	  The patch includes the /etc/wmbutton.conf as global configuration
	  file. This file is readed if $home/.wmbutton don't exists.
	Version simplification
	  This patch is based in the code wrote by Christian Aichinger
	  for the Debian distribution.
	  The patch simplify the version number in the code.
	Better Makefile
	  This patch is based in the code wrote by Christian Aichinger
	  for the Debian distribution.
	  Changes are:
	  - Removed the compilation of ctags by default
	  - Changed the include /usr/X11R6/include/X11 to /usr/include
	  - Created install option
	wmbutton.c code clean
	  This patch is a code clean patch:
	  - Removes spaces and tabs at end of line.
	  - Remove curly brackets not needed.
	  - Change spaces by tabs.
	  - Add spaces after and before operators.
	  - Removes spaces not needed.
	  - Better code style.
	Added manpage
	  The manpage is added. This manpage was initially written for Debian,
	  but now is adapted to upstream (I removed a paragraph... nothing
	  more).
	Middle button enabled by default
	  The mouse middle button should be enabled by default (see the help
	  and the manpage). This patch solves this bug.
	  The MIDMOUSE definition is removed because the value of MIDMOUSE
	  changes the middle button behaviour. Now, the middle button always
	  works, except if the user uses the -m argument.
	  Now the manpage and the help show the same info.
	wmbutton.h and wmb_libs.c code clean
	  This patch is a code clean patch:
	  - Removes spaces and tabs at end of line.
	  - Remove curly brackets not needed.
	  - Change spaces by tabs.
	  - Add spaces after and before operators.
	  - Removes spaces not needed.
	  - Better code style.
	  - Added void as function argument.
	initTooltip has no argument
	  The function initTooltip don't have arguments, so their can be
	  removed.  Now the function prototype has the void argument set.

0.6.1 Minor changes to the Makefile.

0.6 Code cleanup and fixes for memory leaks by Christian 'Greek0' Aichinger.

0.5	Added Modifications submitted by Ralf Horstmann.
	  Load different pixmaps at start-up time, rather than having
	  to compile them in.  This also makes it much easier to run
	  multiple copies.
	Added Modifications submitted by Michael Cohrs.
	  Added Tool-Tips
	Updated default buttons.xpm graphics
	General Code clean-up, including export must functions to
	  seperate C file, to reduce clutter.

0.4	Added Modifications submitted by Casey Harkins.
	  Start application on mouse button release,
	  Only start app if cursor is still on application button
	  Added 3-D button press look
	Added new .wmbutton configuration file

0.3	Graphics changed to incorporate most changes made by asbutton
	Removed Middle/Right mouse click on button to turn off buttons
	  after it.
	Added Middle and Right mouse buttons to run more Applications
	  (Yes, you can now really run 27 different Apps from a single
	  instance of wmbuttons, if you would want too...)
	Fixed bug for finding config file .wmbutton.
	  It used to not look in the home directory, but in the
	  startup directory.  Thanks to Casey harkins for the fix.
	Included the icons directory from the asbutton distribution,
	  plus a few more.

0.2	Added single configuration file, user selectable.

0.1	Origional version.
	  Shamelessly taken from wmcp 1.2.5,
	  by Ben Cohen <buddog@aztec.asu.edu>
