What is wmCalClock?
-------------------

wmCalClock is a simple Calendar Clock that uses anti-aliased characters and
drop shadows. Doesn't do much except tell time...


What is wmCalClockKbd?
----------------------

wmCalClockKbd has all features of wmCalClock and add very simple actual
keyboard group indicator (for XFree86 >= 4.3.0).
In another way, it's dockable application for WindowMaker (but you can also
use it in AfterStep, BlackBox, ...) window manager. wmCalClockKbd can show
actual time, date and keyboard group. This application was written, because I
could not find any application such wmkbd, which I use with previous versions
of XFree86. I could not think out any nice looking app using the whole dock
icon, so I modified one of the app in my dock. The inspiration was also
gSwitchIt applet and its libxklavier.


Installation
-----------

You also need to have installed devel packages of XFree86 and libxpm in order
to compile this application. Then unpack the application and run

  make
  make install (as root)

to compile and install. You shouldn't have any problem with it, application was
tested on Mandrake Linux 9.1. There might be also some .rpm packages on
project web pages.
The wmCalClockKbd should also run on other un*x systems too, but I don't test
it. If you have any good experience of running it on such system, please send
me some report describing this system.


Usage
-----

If you want to use the keyboard indicator, you really need to have
XFree86 >= 4.3.0! If you use more keyboard maps, it should be set properly.
There is example of my X86Config-4 InputDevice section:

  Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier "Keyboard1"`		# keyboard name
    Driver "Keyboard"
    Option "XkbModel" "pc102"		# you might use pc105, if you have Win keys on your keyboard
    Option "XkbLayout" "us,cz_qwerty"	# most important! I have configured two keyboard layouts (groups) - US/ASCII and Czech(qwerty), you can use up to 4 layouts
    Option "XkbCompat" ""
    Option "XkbOptions" "default,grp_led:scroll,grp:alt_shift_toggle,grp:switch"
  #			    ^^^ use some default options to avoid Mandrake bug
  #					^^^ indicate alternative groups by switching the scroll led
  #							^^^ switch groups by pressing Alt+Shift (left)
  #									^^^ use right alt to set second group, while it is pressed down
  EndSection

you can also use setxkbmap, if you don't want to edit you XF86Config-4:

  setxkbmap -layout "us,cz_qwerty,de" -option "default,grp:alt_shift_toogle"

for example. Once, when you have configured your keyboard properly, you can
run wmCalClockKbd with -kb option:

  wmCalClockKbd -kb "us.xpm,cz.xpm"

which tells to wmCalClockKbd to use us.xpm file for first group and cz.xpm for
the second group. Images are taken from the default location specified in
PREFIX file. You can use up to 4 images, but the number of images must be the
same as number of configured layouts (groups), otherwise app disable keyboard
indicator functions. Please make also sure, that there is your national image
in pixmaps directory. If not, you can make new one (dimension are 54x35
pixels, color depth depends on you system) and send it to me (I will add it to
source files, but please don't break any Copyrights when making it).
There is another one new option -kbt, which sets how much will be the keyboard
image transparent when merging with date sign (default options is 0.25, you
can you any number from 0.0-1.0, but useful values are 0.1-0.5).
All wmCalClock options works like in the original version, you can read about
them in olddoc/ dir of source codes or use -help switch.
