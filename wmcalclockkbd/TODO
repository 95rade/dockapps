* Try to find some more effective way to put two images together (flag and
  actual date), current way using XGetPixel and XPutPixel seems to be rather
  slow.
* Create or collect from users more flag images.
* Create some autoconf installation, but I afraid, that the tar.gz package
  size will grow of 200 KB.
* Add some check, that we really use XFree86 >= 4.3.0.
