wmusic (1.4.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream (Only changes to included libdockapp, which we don't use
    since there is an debian package)
  * Modified patch from (1.2.6-3 / #86939 / Spinning arrow when stopped)
    to work only, if command line argument -a or --rotate-arrow is given.
    Upstream is unresponsive at the moment, so I'm releasing this now.
  * Changed Manpage to reflect the new patch.
  * Changed debian menu entry to start with --rotate-arrow by default, too
