CHANGE LOG:
-----------
0.7     Fix reference to config file in manpage.
	Remove trailing whitespace.
	Update mailing list links to new Google Groups.
	Null-terminate display string when clearing.
	 Often, the number currently being displayed has more than 10 digits.
	 However, when clearing the display, only the first 10 digits were
	 cleared.  When a new number was entered, it would be prepended to any
	 digits that weren't cleared.  This behavior was invisible to the user,
	 causing incorrect calculations, e.g., Debian bug #564173:
	   1814 / 720 * 300 -> 7568.41111
	 But the correct answer is 755.833333.
	 The problem was that when the display was cleared, the string that
	 stores this number was not null-terminated.  Indeed, 1814 / 720 gives
	 us 2.519444444 (6 4's), but only 2.51944444 (5 4's) is displayed.  When
	 we begin to multiply by 300, the final 4 remained, and so we really
	 were multiplying by 3004.
	Use autotools for build.
	Remove unused image files.
	Use version number from autoconf.
	Add icon for freedesktop.org icon themes.
	Add freedesktop.org desktop entry file.

0.6	Increase significant digits.  Patch by Antony Gelberg
	 <antony@wayforth.co.uk> to fix Debian bug #320597 [1].  Obtained from

	Fix typo in Makefile.  Correctly create the directory
	 /usr/share/man/man1 instead of /usr/share/man/man1/man1.  Obtained
	 from the Debian package [3].
	Fix manpage spelling.  Avoid Lintian warning in the Debian package.
	 Obtained from [4].
	Move changelog from README to new ChangeLog file.
