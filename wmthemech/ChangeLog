wmThemeCh

Version	Changes
---------------
0.3	* Support for not only WindowMaker themes but also backgrounds.
	* Added feature asked and implemented by Andreas Bunten :
	  -a <time> option peridically changing current theme.
	* In themes and backgrounds directories, wmThemeCh database file
	  changed from name "categories" to "wmThemeCh.cat.db" in *.themed and
	  ".wmThemeCh.cat.db" elsewhere. That way, categories entries do not
	  show up in WindowMaker menus.
	* Database files now have a signature :
		"# wmThemeCh categories database file version 1.0"
	* autoconf scripts enhaced, now exits when a dependancy is missing,
	  support for FreeBSD.
	* Database model rewritten. Now more space efficient, extensible.
0.2	* Some default categories have been added.
	* Fixed a bug causing crash if GNUSTEP_USER_ROOT wasn't defined,
	  effectively crashing if the window manager wasn't Window Maker.
	* Compiling directives now use autotools.
0.1	* Initial public release
