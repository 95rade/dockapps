wmThemeCh is a WindowMaker theme (and background) changer dockapp.

Left-click  selects another theme/background.
Right-click selects another category.

Themes are collected from the standard WindowMaker themes and background
directories.

You can define categories in ~/.wmThemeCh/categories ,
each line defining a category name.
The icon corresponding to that category will be ~/.wmThemeCh/<name>.xpm
Icons are 56 x 56 pixels.

A theme belongs to a category if either :
1) a valid "wmThemeCh.cat.db" file lies in theme's directory
   (for .themed format only), and a line of that file is category's name.
   Note that ".wmThemeCh.cat.db" also is supported.
2) a valid ".wmThemeCh.cat.db" file lies in a parent directory
   and a line of that file is category's name.

Example
-------

File /usr/local/share/wmthemech/categories :

People

/usr/local/share/wmthemech/People.xpm

File ~/.wmThemeCh/categories :

Anime
Cartoons

~/.wmThemeCh/Anime.xpm
~/.wmThemeCh/People.xpm

~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/Themes/.wmThemeCh.cat.db :

# wmThemeCh categories database file version 1.0
Anime
Misc

~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/Themes/MyTheme.themed/wmThemeCh.cat.db :

# wmThemeCh categories database file version 1.0
People
Art

MyTheme belongs to Anime and People categories.
It would also belong to Art and Misc if those were defined.
People category icon would be the one in ~/.wmThemeCh , overriding
the default one.
