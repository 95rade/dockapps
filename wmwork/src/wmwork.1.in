.TH WMWORK 1 "January 2005" "The Debian Project" "Version @PACKAGE_VERSION@"
.
.SH NAME
.
wmwork \- keep track of time worked on projects
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.
.B wmwork
.RI [ options ]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B wmwork
provides a monitor on a 64x64 mini window that helps you keeping track of
your time. The idea is based on the program
.I Worklog
written by Truxton King Fulton II. In contrast to
.I Worklog
.B wmwork
is a graphical application designed to work with the WindowMaker dock, but
will work with other window managers as well.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.BR \-d ,\  \-\-days
displays time in ddd.hh:mm instead of hhh:mm:ss. Note that if one timer is
at least 1000 hours large this will be the case anyway.
.TP
.BR \-f ,\  \-\-force
overwrite stale lock files. Use this if
.B wmwork
says that it's already running but it isn't.
.TP
.BR \-h ,\  \-\-help
display a command line summary.
.TP
.BR \-v ,\  \-\-version
display the version number.
.TP
.BI \-\-display= id
set the display to use, e.g.
.RI \-\-display= :0.0 .
.TP
.BI \-\-geometry= pos
set the position of the dock app, e.g.
.RI \-\-geometry= +10+10 .
Note that the size (64x64) is hard-coded and cannot be changed.
.
.SH USAGE
.
When
.B wmwork
is started, the uppermost line shows the accumulated time spent on the
project, identified by a three letter code in the third line. The second
line shows the current time spent on the project and is initially zero.
.PP
The button
.B V
starts the timer, the button
.B ||
pauses it. The button
.B X
stops the timer, saving the accumulated time in
.IR ~/.wmwork/worklog ,
adding the current session time to
.I ~/.wmwork/worklog.XYZ
and resetting the latter.
.PP
The buttons
.B <
and
.B >
switch between the projects found in the file
.IR ~/.wmwork/worklog .
This can be done only if the timer is neither running nor paused.
.
.SH FILES
.
.TP
.B ~/.wmwork/worklog
contains the projects configuration and log summaries.
.PP
Each line has the form
.IR identifier:timestamp[:comment] .
Empty lines and lines beginning with a
.I #
are ignored. Only the first three characters of the (case-insensitive)
identifier are relevant. When
.B wmwork
is overwriting
.I ~/.wmwork/worklog
it cuts the identifiers down that way.
.TP
.B ~/.wmwork/???
contains human readable timestamps for the project
.IR XYZ ,
where
.I XYZ
is the truncated identifier from
.IR ~/.wmwork/worklog .
.PP
Having multiple entries of the same identifier in
.I ~/.wmwork/worklog
is possible. They are counted independently, but will share the same
project file.
