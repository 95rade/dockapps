wmwork: README
--------------

INSTALLATION

On Debian systems, install the Debian package: type 'dpkg -i wmwork_*.deb' as
root. If you need to compile it first, e.g. you want to install the unstable
version on a woody system, type 'dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -tc -uc -us'.

This program requires GNU make. On Non-Debian systems compile the program
typing './configure', 'make' and then 'make install' as root.


UPGRADING

If you are upgrading from a version prior to 0.2.0, wmwork will move
~/.wmworklog to ~/.wmwork/worklog and ~/.wmworklog.XYZ to ~/.wmwork/XYZ if it
detects a missing ~/.wmwork and an existing ~/.wmworklog.


HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM

Please read the manual page, type 'man wmwork'.


WHAT DO YOU WANT?

All of the author's requirements are implemented in wmwork now. Are there any
additional features you would like to see implemented? Please tell me if you
