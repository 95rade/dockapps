WARNING!!! WMPop3 is to be used at your own risk. I will not be held
responsible for any damages this application may cause your system.

1) WHAT IS THIS
    WMPop3 is a POP3 mail box checker. It will connect to a POP3
server to check if you have mail, if you do then it will alert you 
of new mail and how many messages are currently in you mail box.

2) How do I configure WMPop3
    WMPop3 when first executed will check if there is a .wmpop3rc
file in the users home directory, it will create this if it can not
be located. This file must be edited and the following fields must
be changed :

    1) popserver - this is the name of the pop3 server.
    2) port      - this is the port the pop3 server is on.( default 110)
    3) username  - users pop3 login name.
    4) password  - users pop3 login password.
    5) autochecking - This allows to disable or enable auto mail
                   checking. 1 enables, 0 disables
    6) mailcheckdelay - Number of minutes, before checking mail.
                  (default = 10 minutes)
    7) mailclient - this is the mail client you use to send/retrieve
                   messgaes(default pine)
    8) viewallmessages - This allows for alternating mail views, 0 shows
                   unread and read messages, 1 shows only unread messages.

3) Using WMPop3.

    This is the easy part..

    1) If you have no mail, WMPop3 will show a empty mail bin.
    
    2) If you have new mail, WMPop3 will show a mail bin containing
        a message.
    
    3) Depending on the option chosen for viewallmessages, either, 
                a) The number of read and unread messages in you mail box 
                    will be shown below the mailbox image. 
                b) The number of unread messages currently in your mail box
                    will be shown below the mail box image..

       * The right button is now used to toggle both views.
    
    4) To run your configured mail reader, mouse click on the mail bin.
    
    5) To manually check for mail at any time, mouse click on the 
          center grey button marked "CHECK" on the bottom.
    
    6) To turn off auto mail checking mouse click bottom left button
       marked "AC". A red led will appear up in the top right hand
       corner, this means that auto mail checking is disabled.
