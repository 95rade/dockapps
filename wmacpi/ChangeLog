2003 July 6 0.50
	Finally got rid of that annoying button - that space now contains
	a 'B 1' or 'B 2' (only those two at present, since I'm too lazy to
	fix it so that the number is generic. It should work fine for
	anyone who doesn't have a freakish system with more than two
	batteries . . .)

	A few more code cleanups.
	
2003 July 1 0.19
	libacpi cleanups and reworking - we now handle the charging
	battery case properly, it seems. 

	Also, some attempts to make error printing a bit cleaner; still a
	long way to go on that, though . . .
	
2003 June 24 0.15
	Removed process_plugin_timer(), since it was doing nothing useful
	at all . . .
	
2003 June 23 0.14
	Removed libapm.c - wmacpi-ng is specifically for ACPI, with no APM
	support. 
	
2003 June 23 0.13
	Some more code cleanups, designed to move libacpi to more of a
	library than something built into wmacpi-ng. This is useful with
	the seperate programs, though at present it's not used much.
	
2003 June 21 0.12
	Added a command line tool, acpi-ng to query battery status from
	the command line.
	
2003 May 30 0.11
	Implemented multiple battery support, and averaging of the samples
	in an attempt to even out the jumpiness of the timer.
	
2003 May 30 0.10
	More major code cleanups: in particular the handling of the power
	panel and the message has been cleaned up so that it's actually
	sane and clean. 

	Next step from here is to actually implement handling of multiple
	batteries, so that if there's a fully charge second battery
	available it reports the correct time remaining (based on the
	present rate of power consumption and the sum of the two battery's
	remaining capacities).
	
2003 May 29 0.3
	Some major reworking of the internals, to help fix the handling of
	multiple batteries and such things. 
	
2003 May 26 0.2a
	Code cleanups to fix various problems with corner cases.
	
2003 May 26 0.2
	Added support for multiple batteries: I took the simple route of
	displaying only one battery per instance - to do more I'd need to
	hack with the display code, and I'm not ready for that yet.
	
	Added a -m option to specify the battery number to monitor.
	
2003 May 26 0.1
	Changed package completely, to support the new ACPI code as of
	2.4.21-rc2. 

	Since this code hasn't been touched in more than a year, I figure
	I might as well have a go at hacking on it . . .

2002 Feb 17 1.34
    Updated ACPI statistics gathering code for the latest ACPI patch from
    Intel. Now uses/checks for subsystem version 20020214+. Redone the version
    check a little bit.

2001 Apr 29 1.33
    Little fix to ACPI version check so that I don't have to make a new
    version each time a new kernel comes out

2001 Mar 24 1.32
    Split ACPI and APM portions in different source files
    Added power_init() function - handles checking subsystem presence,
    version, etc.  Enumerates batteries in ACPI implementation
    ACPI: Beginnings of multiple battery support - not fully implemented
    ACPI: Get the battery ID from /proc/acpi/battery instead of hard-coding
          it in - also helps with multi battery stuff
    Added some stupid command line help
    Added -c option to set critical battery alarm level.  Defaults to
    10 percent, and added -b option to make noise when this critical level
    is reached
    APM: Updated for critical alarm stuff
    Made a 20 color "low" quality pixmap for machines running 8bit displays
    Updated README with some stuff, made separate INSTALL file

2001 Mar 13 1.31
    Update for intel ACPI release version 20010313
    Minor updates for new /proc layout

2001 Mar 07 1.3
    Update for intel ACPI release verion 20010302
    Proc format changed a little bit, so updates were necessary.
    Added a check for specific acpi subsystem version - since each
    new version seems to have a new interface, better be safe than
    sorry :)
    As usual, please test and report to me.

    This ONLY works with linux acpica 20010302.  Download this version from
    http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads.htm - it's a
    patch against 2.4.2

2001 Feb 28 1.21
    Finally read through the ACPI specification.  Hah, they had all my
    questions answered :)  Thus,

    Confirmed remaining percentage formula (correct)

    Now calculate "time remaining" according to the spec formula

    Removed "battery load" hack since we now have "time remaining"

    Fixed bug in display_percentage (10% didn't display right)

    Released version 1.21

2001 Feb 23 1.2
    Added support for ACPI.  This is very untested, and not very clean.
    This has been tested on machines with only ONE battery, and only
    with kernel 2.4.2 (that's where ACPI started to work for me)

    Added some hackery to do with ACPI.  Check README.

    Released 1.2

2001 Jan 16 1.1
    Fixed all the stuff so that wmapm works as advertised:
    	Fixed dumb bug where after charging was done new message didn't scroll.

    	Added support for fucked APM bioses that display stuff wrong. (See
	README to learn how to enable it. Obviously, it's disabled by default)
	
    	Reorganized apminfo structure and got rid of redundancy.
	
    	Reorganized acquire_apm_info.  All APM data is processed there.
	
    	Fixed display_state to do the Right Thing.
	
    	Fixed red blinking button to actually blink on critical battery, and
    	to stop when it isn't critical anymore.  I don't think it ever worked
	right in 1.0.

    Created ChangeLog.

    Updated README.

    Released 1.1.
