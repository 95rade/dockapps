2002 Feb 17 1.34
    Updated ACPI statistics gathering code for the latest ACPI patch from
    Intel. Now uses/checks for subsystem version 20020214+. Redone the version
    check a little bit.

2001 Apr 29 1.33
    Little fix to ACPI version check so that I don't have to make a new
    version each time a new kernel comes out

2001 Mar 24 1.32
    Split ACPI and APM portions in different source files
    Added power_init() function - handles checking subsystem presence,
    version, etc.  Enumerates batteries in ACPI implementation
    ACPI: Beginnings of multiple battery support - not fully implemented
    ACPI: Get the battery ID from /proc/acpi/battery instead of hard-coding
          it in - also helps with multi battery stuff
    Added some stupid command line help
    Added -c option to set critical battery alarm level.  Defaults to
    10 percent, and added -b option to make noise when this critical level
    is reached
    APM: Updated for critical alarm stuff
    Made a 20 color "low" quality pixmap for machines running 8bit displays
    Updated README with some stuff, made separate INSTALL file

2001 Mar 13 1.31
    Update for intel ACPI release version 20010313
    Minor updates for new /proc layout

2001 Mar 07 1.3
    Update for intel ACPI release verion 20010302
    Proc format changed a little bit, so updates were necessary.
    Added a check for specific acpi subsystem version - since each
    new version seems to have a new interface, better be safe than
    sorry :)
    As usual, please test and report to me.

    This ONLY works with linux acpica 20010302.  Download this version from
    http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads.htm - it's a
    patch against 2.4.2

2001 Feb 28 1.21
    Finally read through the ACPI specification.  Hah, they had all my
    questions answered :)  Thus,

    Confirmed remaining percentage formula (correct)

    Now calculate "time remaining" according to the spec formula

    Removed "battery load" hack since we now have "time remaining"

    Fixed bug in display_percentage (10% didn't display right)

    Released version 1.21

2001 Feb 23 1.2
    Added support for ACPI.  This is very untested, and not very clean.
    This has been tested on machines with only ONE battery, and only
    with kernel 2.4.2 (that's where ACPI started to work for me)

    Added some hackery to do with ACPI.  Check README.

    Released 1.2

2001 Jan 16 1.1
    Fixed all the stuff so that wmapm works as advertised:
    	Fixed dumb bug where after charging was done new message didn't scroll.

    	Added support for fucked APM bioses that display stuff wrong. (See
	README to learn how to enable it. Obviously, it's disabled by default)
	
    	Reorganized apminfo structure and got rid of redundancy.
	
    	Reorganized acquire_apm_info.  All APM data is processed there.
	
    	Fixed display_state to do the Right Thing.
	
    	Fixed red blinking button to actually blink on critical battery, and
    	to stop when it isn't critical anymore.  I don't think it ever worked
	right in 1.0.

    Created ChangeLog.

    Updated README.

    Released 1.1.
