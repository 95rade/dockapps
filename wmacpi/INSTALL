The basic install is very simple: make, make install.

You can change the default install prefix (/usr/local) by specifying
it in the make install command, eg: make install PREFIX=/usr

To build the command line tool, either uncomment the BUILD_CLI=1 line
in the Makefile, or specify BUILD_CLI=1 on the make command line. ie, 
make BUILD_CLI=1
make install BUILD_CLI=1

No uninstall is supported, but isn't exactly difficult to delete all
the files by hand . . .

Files installed (paths relative to PREFIX):
bin/wmacpi
bin/acpi
man/man1/wmacpi.1
man/man1/acpi.1
