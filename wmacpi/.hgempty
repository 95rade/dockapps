Fixes for compiling against libdockapp-0.5.0
This amounted to a four line patch - narrowing the type of
the dockapp width and height to an unsigned short.

Unfortunately this isn't compatible with libdockapp-0.4.0
now.

Fix for 'charged' battery status
Some batteries report their status as 'discharging' when they're
fully charged, some report their status as 'charged' - previously
I was only checking for 'discharging' when switching out of the
battery charging state, now we check for 'charged' as well.

This fixes part of Debian bug #393617.
