For install instructions, see "INSTALL" file.

Usage:

+-------------+
|battery graph| <- visual percentage battery remaining
|[:][=] [100%]| <- [:] - on AC (blink when charging) [=] - on battery
|[00:00] [///]| <- [00:00] time remaining   [///] timer mode switch
|status   area| <- messages scroll here
+-------------+

see wmacpi -h for some command line switches

Timer mode, available only when "on-battery", keeps track how long your laptop
has been away from AC power.  Clicking the button toggles between timer and
standard "time remaining" mode.

******************************************************************************

Implementation of "ACPI" mode:

As far as I know, there aren't any tools available right now to process battery
statistics provided in /proc/power by ACPI stuff in 2.4.x kernels.  This is my
attempt to have a usable dockapp battery monitor for ACPI laptop systems.
Since version 1.32 I've added some code to detect multiple batteries.  However
it's not fully implemented yet, and while it will detect and enumerate
batteries, the statistics reported are for the first found battery.
  * Your battery is "Control Method" type
  * Your ACPI BIOS is supported by current version of ACPI in kernel
    2.4.17 + intel patches
  * You applied acpi subsystem patch version 20020214 (from intel.com)

If you are using kernels or ACPI version older than 2.4.17, keep using 
wmacpi 1.32. This version is only for the latest ACPI code.
To use ACPI support, just follow "INSTALL" instructions.  Makefile has been
updated to include -DACPI. If you don't have ACPI, you don't need this version
of wmacpi. Information below only applies to APM systems, without ACPI support.

Implementation of "APM" mode

This works on all machines that have a standard non-borked APM implementation.
For people with broken APM implementations, I added some stuff, which was
sent to me by Daniel Pittman <daniel@rimspace.net>, to compensate for some
of the stupidity.  If you see dumb behaviour from wmapm, consider editing
wmapm.c and uncomment one, or both, of these lines (on lines 19 and 20):

#define RETARDED_APM if your bios thinks the battery is charging all the time
when it's on AC power.  What this will do is stop "charging" process as soon
as the battery reaches 100%.

#define STUPID_APM if your bios shows -1 minutes remaining when AC is plugged
in, or when battery is charging.

If your bios is even dumber than this, and you come up with another special
case that needs to be handled, feel free to #ifdef it under <badword>_APM and
send me a diff -u.  I will include it in the next version.  Any of these
changes would have to go into acquire_apm_info.  Note, I changed format of
apminfo structure to get rid of redundancy - now there is only one power state
variable, which keeps track whether we are on AC, charging, battery, etc.

Note, all the *_APM stuff is untested - my laptop has a working BIOS :)  If you
test this and it doesn't work as advertised, go ahead and send me a fix.
