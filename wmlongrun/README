WMLongRun - A dockapp to monitor the LongRun(tm) status on Crusoe

General Information
===================
WMLongRun is a program to monitor for LongRun. It displays the current
LongRun(tm) settings and status: the frequency, the LongRun(tm) flags
(performance or economy), and the performance level (expressed as a percentile).

It is a dockapp (dockable application) that is supported by X window managers
such as Window Maker, AfterStep, BlackBox, and Enlightenment. It has two user
interfaces: an LCD look-alike user interface and an LED-interface. If you select
the LCD-interfaces, the back-light may be turned on/off by clicking the mouse
button over the application.

It runs on GNU/Linux / FreeBSD.
