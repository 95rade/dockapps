Supported Platforms:
====================

- GNU/Linux (kernel 2.4.x / 2.2.18 or later)
- FreeBSD (5.0-CURRENT / 4.4-RELEASE or later)

Patches to make it work on other platforms are welcome.


Requirements:
============
- Basic obvious stuff
	If you will build WMLongRun, make sure you have gcc (or some Other ANSI
	C compiler).the X header files installed.

- X11R6.x
	WMLongRun can NOT be compiled in older versions of X, like X11R5 or
	X11R4. Upgrading the client libraries (Xlib, Xext) will help if you
	can't upgrade the server.

- libXPM 4.7 or newer
	Older versions may not work.
	Available at ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/X/

- CPUID/MSR drivers. (GNU/Linux)
	To run WMLongRun under GNU/Linux, you will need CPUID/MSR drivers.
	These drivers have been a part of the kernel distribution since version
	2.2.18. (2.4.x kernel has already included support for CPUID/MSR.) Make
	sure your kernel was compiled with 'CONFIG_X86_CPUID=y' and
	'CONFIG_X86_MSR=y'. If the CPUID/MSR drivers are not already built, you
	will need to configure and build a new kernel. You can either build the
	CPUID/MSR drivers into the kernel or build them as kernel loadable
	modules.

- CPUID/MSR character devices (GNU/Linux)
	To get the information of the LongRun settings and status, you may need
	to make the special character files in the /dev directory. Please type
	as following to see if these devices already exist.

	 $ ls -l /dev/cpu/0/*
	 crw-------   1 root    root     203,  0 Sep 27  00:16 /dev/cpu/0/cpuid
	 cr--r--r--   1 root    root     202,  0 Sep 27  00:16 /dev/cpu/0/msr

	If not, you will need to create them. There is a MAKEDEV-cpuid-msr
	script in the source distribution of WMLongRun which will create
	the CPUID/MSR devices for you. You can also do it yourself.
	As root, type:

	 $ mkdir -m 0755 -p /dev/cpu/0
	 $ mknod /dev/cpu/0/msr -m 0600 c 202 0
	 $ mknod /dev/cpu/0/cpuid -m 0444 c 203 0


Installation:
=============

1: tar -zxvf wmlongrun-<version>.tar.gz
2: cd wmlongrun-<version>
3: ./configure
4: make
5: su root
6: make install (or 'make install-strip')
7: wmlongrun &

NOTES:
- WMLongRun is installed as a setuid-root program on GNU/Linux. A setuid
  program with a graphical user interface is NOT secure. Please use at your own
  risk.
- Non-GNU make may not work.
  e.g.) it doesn't work on FreeBSD when you run 'make clean'.
