---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q1.1: How can I see what is going on with my connection ?

A1.1: The ppp daemon throws lots of logging information (if asked to),
      but some of this information may get lost.
      Change your /etc/syslog.conf file so that is has a line

        daemon,local2.debug,daemon.notice          /etc/ppp/log

      (the separation is made out of *tabs*, NOT spaces!)

      and create a zero-sized log file:

        touch /etc/ppp/log

      Then restart the syslog daemon (e.g.: send a SIGHUP to it as root).
      Then enable the debug and kdebug options at yawmppp.pref's PPP options
      notebook page.

      The log file should give more information than you actually need.
      Even if you don't want to change your logging configuration, some of
      pppd's log output may go to /var/log/messages.



Q1.2: Nothing happens when I hit the "V" button.

A1.2: The pppd daemon requires root privileges to run. The solution here is
      to set the setuid bit on pppd's executable:

        chmod 4755 `which pppd`

      You must run this as root. Notice that the quotes are backticks.



Q1.3: Yawmppp/pppd complain about not having root privileges.

A1.3: Maybe you're trying a noauth connection with a non-setuid pppd. If you
      really need to keep pppd non-setuid root, add the

       noauth

      line to your

       /etc/ppp/options

      file.

Q1.4: Why doesn't it shows with the NeXTSTEP(tm) look
      in my system as it does in the screenshots ?

A1.4: The GTK+ GUI toolkit allows themeing. It means that you may turn
      your GTK+ applications to look like Macintosh(tm), Aqua(tm),
      NeXT(tm) or whatever you want. Even Windows(tm) if you're sick
      enough for it.
      You can make your themes or download ready ones (faster).

      There are lots of GTK+ themes at

      http://gtk.themes.org

      You can browse documentation on how to add the themes at the same
      site. To use gtk.themes.org pixmap themes you'll probably need
      the gtk-engines and imlib packages, you can find them perusing
      the site.

      The NeXT look seen in the screenshots at yawmppp.seul.org is
      provided by the Xenophilia engine:

      http://www.obsession.se/johan/gtk.html

      (if this link ever gets broken, search for Xenophilia at
       freshmeat.net)

Q1.X: Where can I get more info ?

A1.X: You can read the PPP-HOWTO and ISP-Hookup-HOWTO from the LDP
      (Linux Documentation Project), available from

       http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/

      (Linux distributions may have it installed under /usr/doc/HOWTO)


      You can also read the ppp FAQ that comes with ppp's source, which
      can be downloaded from:

       ftp://cs.anu.edu.au/pub/software/ppp


Q2.1: How do I setup PAP/CHAP ?

A2.1: PAP and CHAP are authentication protocols and some ISPs require them to
      be used. Their purpose is to confirm identity throughout the connection.
      Unless you're afraid of someone tapping your phone line and transmitting
      "bogus" data through YOUR PPP link, you should not worry about it, unless
      your ISP does.

      First, you'll have to set yawmppp.pref's local PPP options on your
      ISP entry to reflect the desired behaviour about CHAP/PAP.
      If your ISP doesn't even present a login prompt, you'll want to
      check the "don't generate login/password pairs" in the "More Settings"
      dialog.

      Then, as root, edit /etc/ppp/chap-secrets and/or /etc/ppp/pap-secrets
      as desired.
      The ppp FAQ (included in the source distribution of ppp) tells the nitty
      gritty, but basically you'll have a set of lines, one for each ISP that
      reads like this:

        username * password

      where username is your username, password is your password. The
      first * means the server (any) and the second * means the allowed IPs
      (any). The log output of ppp may help you if you still can't get a
      conection. Read Q1.1 for instructions to get the most of ppp's log.



Q2.2: My modem dials, connects, but hangs up some seconds later.
      What is happening ?

A2.2: There are several possibilities, which you will only be sure by reading the
      logs. Here they are:

      1. bad login/password, or your ISP is under maintenance and refused login

      2. the ISP required CHAP/PAP authentication and you either didn't have
         a proper secret to give in the secret files (read Q2.1), or
         has the refuse-chap/refuse-pap options on, or had a bad (wrong) secret.
         If this is the case, asking help from your ISP is a good idea.

      3. your ISP is taking too long to answer for the initial PPP requests.
         It may be busy, buggy, bad configured, or gone BSOD (Q2.3).
         You can try setting on the "passive" option or increase the
         lcp-max-configure number.
