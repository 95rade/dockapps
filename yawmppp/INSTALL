Installation instructions for YAWMPPP. 

Upgrading ?
-----------
If so, just follow the usual INSTALL instructions, run
yawmppp.pref and click Ok or Apply. It will not
damage your previous versions' ISP entries or log, and will write the
new pppd command line to your ~/.yawmppp scripts.

Upgrading from 1.x.x to 2.x.x:
------------------------------
The configuration files of 2.x.x are placed separated from 1.x.x
files. You are can uninstall 1.x.x before installing 2.x.x, but it
isn't necessary. (to do so, unpack the 1.x.x tar.gz, configure and
make uninstall).


Just notice that if you chmod'ed the files in ~/.yawmppp to
prevent yawmppp from overwriting your manual changes, the
new version will not be able to add new data to them, ok ?

NOTE!
--------------------------------------------------------------
Installing this program requires root privileges, ask your 
local system/network administrator kindly if she/he wants
to install this software for you ;-)

you need root access for installation.

What the installation will do
----------------------------------------------------------

	The installation requires a program
        be copied to /etc/ppp:

        /etc/ppp/yagetmodemspeed

        and will also copy an icon to /usr/local/share/icons

        the yawmppp binaries will be installed in
        /usr/local/bin (you can change the /usr/local prefix,
        see below)

        /usr/local/bin/yawmppp
        /usr/local/bin/yawmppp.pref
        /usr/local/bin/yawmppp.log

        the documentation will be installed in
        /usr/local/doc/yawmppp-<version>

        and yawmppp's man page will be placed in
        /usr/local/man/man1 

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------
1) % tar zxvf yawmppp-2.x.x.tar.gz
2) % cd yawmppp-2.x.x
3) % ./configure
4) % make
5) % su
6) # make install

As non-privileged user:

7) % yawmppp & (try 'yawmppp -h &' for help) 

If you have no ISP entries configured you'll see the yawmppp.pref
GUI.

FreeBSD note: if configure fails to find the X11 includes you may have
to use the --with-x-includes=DIR option, type "configure --help" for
information.

Extras
--------------------------------------------------------------

Changing the prefix: if you want the binaries to be installed
somewhere else than /usr/local, do a

./configure --prefix=/where/I/want/the/prefix/to/be

in the 3) step above.
