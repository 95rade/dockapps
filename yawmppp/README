Overview
--------

YAWMPPP sits in Window Maker's dock (or AfterStep's Wharf, or keeps
standing as a 64x64 window with other Window Managers) and manages
PPP connections. For window managers not capable of docking
yawmppp also provides a bar shaped version (yawmppp.thin).

It includes a GUI to easily setup your ISP entries, so that you
don't need to edit CHAT scripts.

YAWMPPP is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License, version 2 or later (at your choice). A copy of the
license is provided in the file COPYING in this same directory.

Requirements
------------

YAWMPPP is known to run on Linux (tested with 2.2 kernels) and FreeBSD
(tested with 3.4-RELEASE) and has been reported to work with NetBSD 1.5.

You'll need:

- root access to install YAWMPPP

- A kernel with PPP support compiled in.

- pppd, the ppp daemon, installed in /usr/sbin/pppd
  (currently this path mandatory for the builtin scripts to
  work). If you wish to use YAWMPPP as non-root pppd must
  have the setuid bit set. The RedHat installation already
  brings this set.
  Version 2.3.11 or newer is recommended.

- the "chat" program (usually included in the pppd package, comes
  with the FreeBSD distribution too).

- GTK+ 1.2.1 or greater. 1.2.6 recommended.
  If you don't have it you can grab it from

  http://www.gtk.org

  Remember to get the GLib too (needed by GTK+).

  On RedHat-based systems (RedHat itself, Mandrake, Conectiva,
  Independence, etc.) you'll need these packages installed to
  compile YAWMPPP:

  glib-1.2.x
  glib-devel-1.2.x
  gtk+-1.2.x
  gtk+-devel-1.2.x

Author: Felipe Bergo <bergo@seul.org>, who built YAWMPPP
        using code from the WMPPP application developed by
        Martijn Pieterse and Antoine Nulle.

        YAWMPPP's web page is located at
        http://yawmppp.seul.org

Usage Hints
-----------

First of all: you can type "man yawmppp" for help at the command line.

Programs:
---------

yawmppp         - The PPP dock applet

                  (e.g. Enlightenment, Sapphire...)
yawmppp.pref    - The Dialing setup tool (can be run from
                  yawmppp by clicking the left mouse
                  button in the display area)
yawmppp.log     - The log view tool (can be run from yawmppp
                  by clicking the middle or right mouse buttons
                  in the display area)

                                V : connects to currently selected ISP

                                X : closes current connection.

You can click the display area with the left mouse button to open the
ISP configuration tool (yawmppp.pref) or with any other mouse button
to open the connection log viewer (yawmppp.log).

Window Manager Placement
------------------------
Window Maker: Window Maker users simply drag and drop YAWMPPP on
              the WindowMaker Dock or the Clip.
              Press the right mouse button on YAWMPPP's outer edges and
              select "Settings..." from the popup menu that appears.
              Enable the 'Start when WindowMaker is started' option,
              then click on the 'OK' button in the Docked Applications
              Panel.

AfterStep:    Afterstep users put something like this in their Wharf rc
              file "Wharf yawmppp - MaxSwallow "yawmppp" yawmppp &"
              (this should be somewhere under ~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep)

Elsewhere:    For other windowmanagers, YAWMPPP runs nicely as a 64x64
              pixel shaped icon on your desktop. You may prefer to run
              yawmppp.thin when not using Window Maker or AfterStep.

Configuration
-------------

YAWMPPP's configuration files stay beneath ~/.yawmppp2, which will
be created as soon as you run yawmppp for the first time. The main
configuration file is yawmppprc. You should use the yawmppp.pref
application to create your entries. If you're willing to edit entries
by hand, create some bogus entries with yawmppp.pref and take a look
at the generated files for hints. It should be easy to figure out.

The format has changed since YAWMPPP 1.x.x, thus the
directory has changed (from ~/.yawmppp to ~/.yawmppp2).

Don't try copying files between 1.x.x and 2.x.x versions.

Modem ports
-----------
On Linux the serial ports are (or at least should be :-) ):

/dev/cua0  _or_  /dev/ttyS0  : DOS' COM1
/dev/cua1  _or_  /dev/ttyS1  :  "   COM2
/dev/cua2  _or_  /dev/ttyS2  :  "   COM3
/dev/cua3  _or_  /dev/ttyS3  :  "   COM4

If you don't know where your modem is, type

  dmesg | grep tty

It should print something like

  ttyS00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
  ttyS01 at 0x02f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
  ttyS02 at 0x03e8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A

If it shows the wrong irq to you, add a setserial command
to one of your boot time scripts (maybe /etc/rc.d/rc.local)
like:

  /bin/setserial /dev/ttyS2 irq 10

See "man setserial" for more information.

On FreeBSD the dialout serial ports are

  /dev/cuaa0 (kernel interface sio0)
  /dev/cuaa1 (kernel interface sio1)
  /dev/cuaa2 (kernel interface sio2)
  /dev/cuaa3 (kernel interface sio3)

If it fails to recognize your modem's port, or gives it the wrong
IRQ, you have to compile a new kernel with the correct settings.
Read the FreeBSD handbook if don't know how to do this
(/usr/share/doc/books/handbook)

Login/Password Expects
----------------------
The supplied expects for login and password are rather common,
but if it fails, connect to your ISP using a standard communication
program (like minicom) and watch what the ISP sends to ask for
login and password.

More Documentation
------------------
Linux users can read the ISP-Hookup and PPP howtos. These howtos
are available from

  http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/

If you are on a major Linux distribution the HOWTOs should be
installed. Try looking beneath /usr/doc.
