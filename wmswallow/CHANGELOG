(Note: don't get confused, the dates in this file are in german-locale (de_DE),
       because i was too lazy to use something else than
       ctrl-u meta-! date... but the timestamp is in C locale...)

0.6.1: <Mon Mai 15 23:15:29 CEST 2000>
Fixed eternal loop under openwindows (solaris-x86)
      <Mon Mai 15 23:14:54 CEST 2000>
Added wmswallow.spec for easy building of rpm :-)
       <Fre Mai 12 15:50:12 CEST 2000>

0.6: <Fre Mai 12 02:16:30 CEST 2000>
Celebrated first wmswallow version without my favorite bug, with a beer :-)
Made the switches work :-)
       <Fre Mai 12 01:49:49 CEST 2000>
Added commandline switches -managed -unmanaged. -managed is the default
behaviour, we wait for the Window to be reparented.
      <Fre Mai 12 01:27:47 CEST 2000>
Added code from Jason Lowdermilk to listen to CreateWindow Events, after the
app has been started. Then i modified it heavily, because i found it was still
too unreliable. Now wmswallow Listens for ReparentNotify events. So, we rely
on WindowMaker first reparenting the windows, then sleep just a second and can
be sure that everything worked! And i don't think that the Windowmaker
behaviour (or any other windowmanager) will change in that respect :-) Well,
this might not work for xteddy (or other apps that are ignored by the
windowmanager)
	<Fre Mai 12 00:47:24 CEST 2000>
Put code to check window for WM_CLASS and WM_NAME in extra function.
    <Don Mai 11 17:23:13 CEST 2000>

0.5.3: <Don Mai 11 01:02:02 CEST 2000>
Fixed a nasty bug that i introduced by modyfying Jason's patch incorrectly and
some tiny cleanups.
      <Don Mai 11 00:54:38 CEST 2000>
Added thanks to the contributors to README
      <Don Mai 11 00:29:55 CEST 2000>
Incorporated patch from Jason Lowdermilk <lowdermilk@visto.com> to enable
finding windows by WM_NAME (i confused WM_NAME with the name part of the
property returned by XGetClassHint. The patch fixes some memory leaks as well.
Jason says, this helps with some Java-Applications.

0.5.2: <Mit Mai  3 22:03:27 CEST 2000>
Modified README
New switch: -focus/-nofocus, to make focus-handling enabled only on demand,
    more fixes  to focus-handling (this time for real...)
	<Mit Mai  3 21:52:29 CEST 2000>
Small code cleanups, fixes for focus handling (windows could "lose" focus)
	<Mit Mai  3 07:24:09 CEST 2000>
Keyboard focus works now.
	<Die Mai  2 22:35:58 CEST 2000>
Makefile modified, new target xfree tested under linux and freebsd
	<Die Mai  2 14:00:46 CEST 2000>

0.5.1: <Sam Apr 29 13:15:27 CEST 2000>
softenwindows() is superfluous, removed
chidren_return is now XFree'd in findnamedwindowacc()

0.5: <Fre Apr 28 10:30:00 CEST 2000>
Initial beta release, all functionality present, some small bugs, some small
shortcomings.

Shortly after freshmeat announcement i discovered a small bug in the Makefile,
but that was fixed before the news got out.
