This file concerns the usage of scripts with wmisdn. 
----------------------------------------------------


NOTE: The wmisdn scripting is ONLY for ADVANCED unix users. I can't give any
      support for user-made scripts.
	  

Ok, if you're still here, then you know what you're doing, so I won't go into 
details explaining well known things about Linux. 

As of version 1.8, wmisdn can use scripts to control the connection instead of
direct ioctl calls. If you want to use scripts, then put the "-usescripts"
option on the command line. The three files used by wmisdn are

wmisdn-up
wmisdn-down
wmisdn-scriptmodes

They must be located in /etc/isdn/, or in a directory specified by the
"-path" command line option.

The first two are called when the green resp. yellow lamp is pressed. These
two scripts recieve two parameters. The first one is the name of the 
ippp-device and the second is the script mode. 

The script mode is an integer, which corresponds to a line in the file
wmisdn-scriptmodes. Every line in this file defines one script mode - the first
line is mode 0, the second - mode 1, and so on. The contents of each line is
used as a user-friendly name for the script mode and is displayed on the info
window. The script modes are changed by pressing the green control lamp with
the middle mouse button.

A sample wmisdn-scriptmodes might look like

go online
check mail
update web-page

where the wmisdn-up script uses the second command line argument to differ
between these modes (0,1 or 2 resp.). The -up/-down scripts should contain
the line
/usr/sbin/isdnctrl dial $1 
or
/usr/sbin/isdnctrl hangup $1
respectively.

I might consider putting some scripts on my web-page in the near future. I'd 
also wellcome any user-made working scripts.

Good luck and have fun!
