Development History for wmget

wmget 0.6.1 - Now maintained by the Window Maker Developers Team

    * Fix -Wpointer-to-int-cast compiler warnings.  In particular, use intptr_t
      instead of int.  From the Debian patch [1].
    * Fix resource leaks.  In particular, fclose() all the files we fopen().
      From Debian [2].
    * Switch to autotools for build.
    * Remove docbook -> manpage conversion.  It was resulting in compilation
      errors:
        profzoom@cayke:~/src/dockapps/dockapps/wmget$ xsltproc --nonet
          wmget.refentry.xml
        I/O error : Attempt to load network entity
	  http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/1.62/manpages/docbook.xsl
        warning: failed to load external entity "http://docbook.sourceforge.net/
          release/xsl/1.62/manpages/docbook.xsl"
        error
        xsltParseStylesheetFile : cannot parse http://docbook.sourceforge.net/
          release/xsl/1.62/manpages/docbook.xsl
        compilation error: file wmget.refentry.xml line 19 element refentry
        xsltParseStylesheetProcess : document is not a stylesheet
      We therefore remove the xml source file and in the future, we will edit
      the troff file directly. We also add the version number to the manpage via
      autoconf.

wmget 0.6.0 - More options, nominal error handling, fixes

    * New options: auth, proxy_auth, ascii, interface, referer, headers
    * Failed downloads now generate a <filename>.ERROR file containing
      error text, instead of making you guess
    * Minor fixes & cleanups
    * Rewrote much of the manpage, and moved it from POD to DocBook-XML

wmget 0.5.0 - RC file, more options, bugfixes

    * wmget may now be configured via ~/.wmgetrc
    * Cleaned up and more comprehensive command-line options
    * More download options available: proxy support, redirect support,
      and yes, FINALLY... output directory support!
    * Some old source cleanups, and some new source sloppiness.
    * Fix to a bug that created garbage download names

wmget 0.4.4 - Fix to work with libcurl > 7.9.5

    * Thanks again to Rafal Zawadzki for a report: wmget + newer libcurl
      did not show download progress.  After updating my libcurl it
      turns out that the progress callback function signature has
      changed, so a little #iffing and all is well again.

wmget 0.4.3 - Minor bugfixes, cleanups

    * Fixed the makefile sourceball target to unpack into a subdirectory
    * Cleaned up a couple of bits of code
    * Removed -Werror and -g from normal builds
    * Thanks to Rafal Zawadzki for building a .deb and submitting it to
      Debian Sid, and to Kurt Hindenburg for reporting build and tarball
      issues.

wmget 0.4.2 - Fixed AfterStep support

    * The new dockapp code no longer worked right under AfterStep's
      Wharf.  Fixed.  Thanks to Andy Jalics for the email bugreport.
    * Updated the docs to reflect the fact that Window Maker is not the
      only WM out there.  :)

wmget 0.4.1 - Bugfix

    * Off-by-one error in a memmove() caused garbage characters to
      appear at the end of downloaded filenames on the local system in
      certain cases.

wmget 0.4.0 - New ``dockapp'' library, cleanups, features

    * Middle clicking on the dockapp now starts a download of the URI in
      the primary X selection (right-click on a link in Mozilla, select
      ``Copy Link Address'', and middle-click on wmget... presto.)
    * Wrote from scratch a new little library to do dockapp programming.
      Hides all the X stuff, and provides a main loop with a few new
      features.  Replaces the old wmgeneral.c.
    * Fixed default save-name of URL's with no trailing filename
      component---now selects the final path component, whatever it is
      (e.g. http://example.com/ => "example.com"); also fixed the
      display name to always show the basename of the save filename if
      no display name was provided
    * Added a Slackware package target.
    * Corrected/added command line help (LIST was missing...)
    * Cleanups: Makefile, source, docs.

wmget 0.3.0 - A couple of new features, cleanups, fixes

    * Implemented CANCEL and LIST commands
    * Minor doc cleanup
    * Fixed it to work with more recent libcurl's (thanks to Paul Tweedy
      for emailing me about that; I hadn't upgraded my cURL in a while)

wmget 0.2.0 - Rewrite of the client/server ipc.  Renaming.

    Very little user-visible change.

    Rewrote client/server ipc to use text requests/responses over a unix
    domain socket rather than binary structures over a FIFO.

    Also, with this version, I renamed it from ``wmcurl'' to ``wmget''.
    The old name was sorta a poor choice: while I still rely on, and want
    to give full credit to, the cURL guys, the name ``wmcurl'' is
    not very intuitive.  Plus I didn't want people thinking it was part
    of the cURL project proper.  Plus this saves me a keystroke when
    typing it :)

wmcurl 0.1.0 - Initial release.
