Installation instructions for wmGrabImage.

Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need the following free packages to be installed on your system:
	1) ImageMagick  (I use the convert utility (and I want to keep it that way
			 so I can also use all its the processing capabilites in future
			 releases.))
	2) GNU wget
Plus:
wmGrabImage requires the Xpm library (which should be available on most
machines with XFree86 installed).  (Also, you obviously need to be connected to
internet in a way that wget will work.)

Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) gunzip wmGrabImage-1.0.tar.gz
1) tar -xvf wmGrabImage-1.0.tar
2) cd wmGrabImage-1.0/wmGrabImage/
3) make 
4) make install (must be root) 
5) wmGrabImage & (or 'wmGrabImage -h' for help, or 'man wmGrabImage' for the man page)
6) You need to set the location of perl correctly in GrabImage if your perl
   is located in a place other than /usr/bin/
