Installation instructions for wmjmail.

Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
wmjmail requires the Xpm library (which should be available on most machines
with XFree86 installed).   You'll also need a copy of sh, and grep.  That
shouldn't be a problem though.

Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) gunzip wmjmail-#.#.tar.gz

1) tar -xvf wmjmail-#.#.tar

2) cd wmjmail/src

3) edit the Makefile to change the prefix variable and the
   owner and group variables.
   prefix describes where the files go during install.
   owner and group describe who owns it after install.
   You must uncomment owner and group if you use them.

3) make install

4) edit mailchk to make it go.  Currently it relies on mail being in
   /var/spool/mail/$USER, or in perl speak: /var/spool/mail/$ENV{USER}

   Alternatively, use dave's mail script.  It's designed to work with
   "Maildir/" type mail spools.  Search me on what that is.  He told me
   that it works great with his configuration.
