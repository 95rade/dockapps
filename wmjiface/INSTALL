Installation instructions for wmjiface.

Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
wmjiface requires the Xpm library (which should be available on most machines
with XFree86 installed).   You'll also need some version of perl 5+ running.


Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) tar -zxf wmjiface-#.#

2) cd wmjiface/src

3) edit the Makefile to change the prefix variable and the
   owner and group variables.
   prefix describes where the files go during install.
   owner and group describe who owns it after install.
   You must uncomment owner and group if you use them.

4) make install

5) edit ifacechk as necessary to make it go...
   As it stands, ifacechk will not work on SunOS/Solaris.
   I used /proc to get my net info.  Most likely, it won't even
   work on some familiar linux boxes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


If you have problems, please contact me.
Especially if you can make ifacechk work on SunOS.
