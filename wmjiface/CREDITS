I based jDockApp-lib on wmstock.  So I attached the original credits.

The inspiration and some of the code for wmstock came from wmWeather (v1.30),
an excellent dock application.  wmWeather was written by Mike Henderson
and it is available from: 

	http://nis-www.lanl.gov/~mgh/WindowMaker/DockApps.shtml

*** I no longer use this PERL package, but I did take some code from it,
and used it for versions 0.01 and 0.02 ***

I also used some code from the Finance::YahooQuotes PERL Module, which is 
written by Dj Padzensky <djpadz@padz.net> The Finance::YahooQuote home page can
 be found at http://www.padz.net/~djpadz/YahooQuote/


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As I learned more about writing dock apps, I produced more and more of 
my own code, and fixed what I believe were engineering flaws in wmWeather,
however, I recommend to anyone who wants to get started in dock app programming
to start with wmWeather, and perhaps also check out this page:
	
	http://www.inria.fr/koala/lehors/xpm.html (info about XPMs)

Also, for those of you using XPMs in your code, I found its easier to start
with someone elses XPM, use your favorite text editor to rename the
variables in the structure, and then a picture editor (xpaint) to edit the
image.  For me, I had to work with the image as a ppm in xpaint, and then
run ppmtoxpm to convert the image.
