None that I know of... :)

Please send bug reports to mghenderson@lanl.gov or jedgar@fxp.org and
describe the problem as detailed as you can.

Note: all apm statistics are taken directly from
/proc/apm (in Linux) or /dev/apm (in FreeBSD).  If
you see odd behavior with WMAPM (such as
displaying battery time remaining without a
corresponding percentage), please first check the
statistics in /proc/apm (or using your system's
'apm' program to see if the computer/kernel are
properly reporting the applicable statistics.
