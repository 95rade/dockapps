Installation instructions for WMAPM.

Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------
  WMAPM requires the Xpm library (which should be available on
most machines with XFree86 installed).
  In order to compile WMAPM using the Makefile, GNU make must
be used (FreeBSD users, the default BSD 'make' does not work).

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------
1) % tar -zxvf wmapm-3.1.tar.gz
2) % cd wmapm-3.1/wmapm/
3) % make (or gmake on most *BSD systems)
4) % make install (must be root) or simply copy and binary (and
     optionally the man page) to a directory in your path.
     (Makefile does an suid on apm; you must be root to do this.)
5) % wmapm & (or 'wmapm -h' for help, or 'man wmapm' for the man page)

Be sure to read the HINTS and TODO files too!
