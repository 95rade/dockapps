--------------------------------------------------------------

	* Work on NetBSD support.
	* Add GUI to allow user to set things.
	* Add ~/.wmapmrc file to store saved settings.

Your feedback is greatly appreciated! If you have nice
suggestions, ideas, whatever, that aren't on this list, feel
free to mail them to:

If you don't let me know... how am I suppose to know? ;-)
