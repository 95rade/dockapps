wmail is a Window Maker docklet watching your inbox, which is either a ordinary
mbox or a directory conforming to qmails Maildir format. It provides a nice
little GUI displaying some useful pieces of information about your inbox (as
many other nice wm-apps doing nearly the same thing...). Per default it uses
the $MAIL environment-variable to locate the inbox you are using, other mailing
mechanisms like POP or IMAP are not supported - use a tool like fetchmail to
retrieve POP- or IMAP-based mail.
