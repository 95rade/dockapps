The goal of this library is to give programmers a simple yet powerful applet
interface.  This library supports both Dockapps and Gnome 2 Panel Applets.
The applet program doesn't have to care about if the applet will be used on
the Gnome panel or in the dock. The library handles that. Over 50% of the code
in a Dockapp and a Gnome 2 Panel applet does actully only one thing, setting up
the applet window. With GAI, this can be reduced to just a few lines of code.
