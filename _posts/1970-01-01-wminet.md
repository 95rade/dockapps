WMiNet is a dockapp designed for Window Maker, although it should work fine
with AfterStep, or any other window manger for that matter. It monitors useful
server statics so you can tell, at a glance, how many people are using your
system. Mainly useful for a machine set up as a ftp/web server/shell box. WMiNet
is completely configurable, and can watch any TCP port.
