miniCHESS was born out of boredom. I warn you... if you're a chess enthusiast
and play a lot then please use xboard or some other chess gui. Even though
miniCHESS has that kinda cool factor, it does get hard on the eyes. I like using
miniCHESS for games in which I'm in no hurry to finish and go on for a couple
days. Sorry but miniCHESS has no save/restore features yet.
