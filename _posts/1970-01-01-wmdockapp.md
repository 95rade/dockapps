wmDockApp is an empty do nothing dockapp that draw a black rectangle that is
54x54. The only functionality is that it handles expose events. It does however
come with wmgeneral and has many of the functions needed for a typical dockapp
already written. The developer need therefore only write the actual useful code
for their dockapp and the rest can be ignored.  This app is therefore a good
starting point when writing a new dockapp.
