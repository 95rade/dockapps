wmpinboard is a Window Maker dock applet resembling a miniature pinboard. It's
intended to somewhat relieve heavily littered desktops by allowing you to place
reminders on a graphical on-screen pinboard rather than produce a mess of rea
notes all around your keyboard (thus being environmentally A Good Thing, too
;-) ).
