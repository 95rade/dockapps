Wmcalc is simple little application that I am writing. It is specifically designed to be docked in Windowmaker, or 'Swallowed' by wharf in Afterstep. If
you're not familiar with these windowmanagers, check them out in the links section. Of course, it should work in just about any window manager.

Wmcalc is a 64x64 pixel application that performs all the functions (and eventually more) of a simple four function calculator. It includes a 10 digit
alpha-numeric display, and twenty buttons for user input. Clicking on the display will clear the calculator.
