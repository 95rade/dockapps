This is a system monitoring dockapp, visually based on the GNOME "BubbleMon"
applet (here). Basically, it displays CPU and memory load as bubbles in a jar
of water. But that's where similarity ends. New bubblemon-dockapp features
translucent CPU load meter (for accurate CPU load measurement), yellow duck
swimming back and forth on the water surface (just for fun), and fading load
average and memory usage screens. Either of the info screens can be locked to
stay on top of water/duck/cpu screen, so that you can see both statistics at
once. Pretty nifty toy for your desktop. Supports Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and
Solaris 2.6, 7 and 8. Code has been thoroughly optimized since version 1.0, and
even with all the features compiled in, BubbleMon still uses very little CPU
time. Load Average screen locked at about 20% looks particularly sexy (pictured
at right). All the extra "bloated" features can be compiled out or disabled on
command-line, if you prefer original "BubbleMon" look.
