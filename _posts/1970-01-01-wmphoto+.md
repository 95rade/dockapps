wmphoto+ is a Window Maker application that displays the images in the dockable
application window. You can switch the images manually or display them as a
slide show. Each image accepts up to two related commands. You can run them
using mouse buttons when the application displays the image. Using the
alternative configuration directories you can run a few instances of the
program which display the different sets of the images.
