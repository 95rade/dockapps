* automagic adjustment to the currently active workspace (if you happen to switch workspaces using the keyboard or some other Window Maker means)
* configurable look and feel to match your Window Maker theme
* tooltips for the workspace names (if you happen to have to many workspaces and can't remember which is which ;-))
