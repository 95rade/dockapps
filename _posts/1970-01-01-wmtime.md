WMTime displays the time and date and gives you some nice additional features too. It is intended for docking in Window Maker.

It currently provides:

* the time and date;
* a realtime morphing interface (analog <> digital mode);
* auto-scaled and anti-aliased hands;
* localization, displaying the day and date in various languages;
* three user-defined commands to launch.
