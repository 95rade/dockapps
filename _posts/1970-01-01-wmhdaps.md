The goal of wmhdaps is to provide a tool for configuration of the Harddisk
Active Protection System (HDAPS) found in some R/G/T thinkpad models. HDAPS is
realized as an acceleration sensor mounted on systemboard and a userspace tool
which detects based on acceleration values from sensor shocks and freezes the
harddrive(s) until the "shock" is over.

In the current version 0.02 actually is only able to visualize the movements of
the notebook as a 3D model based on the acceleration values read from sensor.
