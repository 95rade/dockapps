PPP dial control and network load monitor with NeXTStep look
wmppp.app provides a PPP activator and network load monitor on a 64x64 mini window. With wmppp you can monitor the total traffic as well as the outbound and inbound traffic. It is designed to work with the WindowMaker dock, but will work great with other window managers as well.
