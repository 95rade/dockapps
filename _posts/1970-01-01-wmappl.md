WMAppl is a simple application launcher for the Window Maker dock. It is loosely
based off of WMButton by Edward Flora. WMAppl is configured with a list of
programs and icons which are displayed within the dockapp. If more than six
icons are configured, the scroll buttons may be used to cycle through the list.
