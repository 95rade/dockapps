It's a system monitor for Linux systems running afterstep, but should work on
other window managers, too. I got fed up with most other wharf system monitors
that didn't show the correct memory usage, and took up too much CPU. asmon also
shows the exact amount of memory used and load avg by the numbers. The CPU bar
is fairly standard, next to it is the current load average. The second bar is
memory usage, taken as a whole, it represent the amount of memory used. The area
before the first tick represents shared memory, the area between the two ticks
is buffered memory, the area from the second tick to the end of the bar
represents cached memory. The number to the right represents the number of megs
currently being used. The third bar represents the amount of swap file used, and
the exact number of megs the swap is using. The bottom right is are page/swap
LED's taken from wmsysmon. The right is uptime. The original program is based
off of Timecop's wmcpu.
