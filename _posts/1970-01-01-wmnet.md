WMnet is a little X dock.app network monitor I wrote for Linux. It was originally inspired by that funky program 'tleds' that blinks your keyboard LED's in response to net traffic, but its a lot more entertaining than that nowadays. I wrote this thing with low cpusage, low memory, and efficient use of screen real-estate in mind.
