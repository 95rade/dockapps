wmArchUp is a very simple program used to monitor for package updates in Arch
Linux. It uses the checkupdates script that come with pacman for safe checking
if there is any package updates. It is a dockapp that is supported by X window
managers such as Window Maker, AfterStep, BlackBox, Fluxbox and Enlightenment.

This dockapp is quite simple. It contains an Arch Linux logo icon. When there is
not package updates then the Arch Linux logo icon is greyed. When there are
package updates then the Arch Linux logo icon is blue. The program check for
updates every 10 minutes.
