This applet gives you an aquarium with some randomly selected fishes that live
there. Well, to tell you the truth, you can get a turtle in your aquarium too.
Some other features this program gives you, except for the part that it gives
you an aquarium with fishes that takes care of itself, no feeding, no cleaning
and so on, is that the temperature scale on the right side shows the current
CPU load. It can also be configurated to display the time and show the status of
numlock, capslock and scrollock. The fishes are done by Jim Toomey, the author
of the "Sherman's Lagoon" comics.
