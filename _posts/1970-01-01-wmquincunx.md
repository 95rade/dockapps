Window Maker dockapp displaying a bean machine.

From Wikipedia [1]:

The bean machine, also known as the *quincunx* or *Galton box*, is a device
invented by Sir Francis Galton to demonstrate the central limit theorem, in
particular that the normal distribution is approximate to the binomial
distribution. Among its applications, it afforded insight into regression to
the mean or "regression to mediocrity".
