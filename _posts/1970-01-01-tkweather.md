TkWeather displays a nice square iconic button showing the current weather
condition on either your Windows or Linux/Unix desktop. TkWeather plays nice as
an Afterstep/Window Maker dockapp. Clicking the button shows the current basic
weather condition values, such as temperature, humidity, and wind. Clicking
again shows additional information, namely the barometric pressure, UV,
visibility, and "heat index". It is written entirely in Perl/Tk and requires
Perl and Tk to be installed if running Linux/Unix. No other software is required
for using the Windows self-installing binary.
