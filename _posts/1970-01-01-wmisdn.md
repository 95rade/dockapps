wmisdn is a dock applet that monitors the i4l ISDN subsystem and lets the user
start/stop/disable a ppp connection on a specified device. It can run as a
docked applet in KDE2 (via kappdock), Window Maker or Afterstep, as well as a
standalone windowed application in any other window manager. On its main window,
wmisdn shows the status of the monitored ippp device.  An additional panel can
be toggled to show extended information about the connection.  wmisdn can
control the ippp connection via three buttons that appear on the upper side of
the main window when toggled using the vertical arrow switch (take a look at the
second screenshot). The green one opens the connection, the yellow one closes it
and the red one disables it.
