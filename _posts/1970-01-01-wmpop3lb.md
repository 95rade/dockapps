WMPop3LB is a multi POP3 accounts mailbox checker. It can connect to up to 6
POP3 accounts to check if you have mail, get the "From:" and "Subject:" header
fields of each mail and display them in a 7 lines window. Messages can be
deleted directly off the servers by selecting the mails to delete and clicking
the "delete" button.
