TODO:
  - get more information from the capshare
    - this will make the interface more useful and allow better management
      of the captured pages
  - display downloaded filename
  - make the wait state have an animation(maybe)
  - reverse engineer the serial protocol used by the capshare to allow use
    without IrDA.
  - suggestions?
