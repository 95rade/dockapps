wmcapshare - a Window Maker dockapp to manage the HP Capshare

Why
  I got sick of having to deal with the openobex sample application as my
only interface to my HP Capshare.  So I finally sat down and dealt with it.
Also HP recently discontinued the product and no longer support it.  I had
been using it with windows when I needed to, but the drivers no longer work
with Win2K.

What
  The HP CapShare is a handheld document scanner.
  wmcapshare is a dockapp to manage the files you upload
