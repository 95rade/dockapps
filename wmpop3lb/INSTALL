Installation instructions.

This has only been tested and compiled on a i386 Linux machine.


    There are two methods to install WMPop3lb, either a system install
where all users have access to this file, OR a single user install
which installs WMPop3lb in the users home directory, this is useful
if you have an account on someone else's computer.

    First thing you should do is the following:

    1> Remember you are using this at your own risk.
    2> tar zxvf wmpop3lbx.x.tar.gz
    3> cd wmpop3lb/wmpop3


Method 1.    System install

A system install will place the WMPop3lb binary in "/usr/local/bin",
this can be done as follows (must be root for this ) :

            make install1

Method 2.   Single user install

A single user install will create a directory called wmpop3lbx.x in the users
home directory, and copy the wmpop3 binary there. This install is as
follows:

            make install2

Make sure you put this new directory in your path.
This usually can be done by placing the following in your login
shell setup file,( .bashrc, .bashrc_profile, .profile, etc ).

        PATH=$PATH:~/wmpop3
