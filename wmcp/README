	Change the number of buttons displayed.


EXAMPLES:
---------
    Use all defaults. Good for WindowMaker.
    mwdl

	Normal X window, non shaped window, send CTRL + ALT + key
    wmdl -w n -s n -c

	2x2 button grid:
	wmdl -x 2 -y 2

	2x3 button grid:
	wmdl -x 2 -y 3
	

NOTES:
------

This pager works by sending synthetic ALT + number key press events to the 
root window.  The "-c" command line switch makes the application send
a CNTRL + ALT + number key which might be of use in another window manager.

Because the ALT key may have different key codes on different X servers,
you can use the -a command line switch to change which meta key is used.
I doubt anyone will ever have to do this though. The Mod1Mask which is the
program's default seems to work on most if not all systems.

I don't know of any Window Maker hooks for determining things like how
may workspaces are actually in use. If any one know about this stuff, please
let me know.

It is very easy to change the look of wmcp by editing the colors in the 
pixmap files. Someday we'll add an official 'skins' ability but for now
just edit the xpm files to change the colors etc.

This program is released under the GPL license and has been created by looking
a lot at the code for wmppp, wmtime, wmload and various other Window Maker
resources and info on the Web and Usenet.


BTW, the one true enlightened way is "Sloppy Focus."


CHANGE LOG:

	   Origional version.

TODO:
-----

Add a simple method for changing 'skins' other than just editing the XPM 
files by hand.

Add catching Window Maker's events to know how to refresh the pager when
the current workspace is changed via the clip, and how to get the number
of workspaces actually in use.


Please send comments, flames, etc to buddog@aztec.asu.edu
