# What is a dockapp?

# How do I add a dockapp?

Our goal is twofold: to serve as a comprehensive directory of all available
dockapps and also to host dockapps which are maintained by the Window Maker
Team.

## My dockapp will be hosted on dockapps.net

## My dockapp will be hosted elsewhere

# How do I add a category?
