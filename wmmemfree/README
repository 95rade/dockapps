WMMemFree - a dockapp

	WMMemFree shows system memory usage. It runs as a dockapp for
WindowMaker or some other window manager which supports dockapps. On the
top side you have your physical memory usage and on the bottom there's
your swap space usage.
	The following options can be passed to WMMemFree on the command
line:
	-h,  --help             - display basic usage info
	-v,  --version          - display version
	-display <DISPLAY>      - specify the X11 display to connect to
	-b,  --buffers          - consider buffer memory
	-nb, --no-buffers       - ignore buffer memory
	-c,  --cache            - consider cache memory
	-nc, --no-cache         - ignore cache memory
	-w,  --window           - run in a window
	-nw, --no-window        - don't run in a window
	-s,  --shape            - use the XShape extension
