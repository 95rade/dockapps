WMTUNLO 
========

It is one of the useless dockapp ever made, so use it or not....

The configuration file is stored in $HOME/.clay/ directory.

There are 8 examples named 'wmtunlorc.example1' thru 'wmtunlorc.example8'.
To test these examples rename selected file to 'wmtunlorc' and put it into 
$HOME/.clay/ directory, then run wmtunlo.

You can assign three programs to run when double-click is performed (look at
options in wmtunlorc file for details).
