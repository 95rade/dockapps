.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBfookb\fP is a Xkb state indicator. It displays
the icon corresponding to the number of Xkb locked group. You may use
mouse-clicks to change Xkb locked group with mouse. Additionally,
\fBfookb\fP can be configured to execute a program on changing group.

\fBfookb\fP man page is based on \fBWMMail.app\fP man page. Program
was written from scratch.
.P
To use \fBfookb\fP with the Window Maker Dock, simply drag the
\fBfookb\fP icon to the Window Maker Dock (if \fBfookb\fP was compiled
with Window Maker support).

.SH EXAMPLES
Here is an example of configuration file.
.P
.nf
{
  Icon1 = "/usr/local/share/fookb/icon1.xpm";
  Icon2 = "/usr/local/share/fookb/icon2.xpm";
  Icon3 = "/usr/local/share/fookb/icon3.xpm";
  Icon4 = "/usr/local/share/fookb/icon4.xpm";

.TP

.SH BUGS
Sometimes \fBfookb\fP receives message about changing XKB group, but
message.state.group does not point to any existing XKB group. In this
case \fBfookb\fP will show IconBoom (from config file) picture.
.P
As far as I know the only way to look at this bug is to run vmware.
