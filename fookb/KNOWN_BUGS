* If configuration parameter 'sound' is not defined, fookb will not die, but
will print error message and kill new-born child every time you switch
keyboard layout. Well, it's not a bug, it's a feature.

* Sometimes fookb receives message about changing XKB group, but
message.state.group does not point to any existing XKB group. In this
case fookb will show IconBoom (from config file) picture.
As far as I know the only way to look at this bug is to run vmware.
