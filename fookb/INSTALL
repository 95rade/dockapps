How to compile and install fookb:

0. The best way

The best way is to install Debian Linux and use apt-get to install precompiled
version of fookb :)

1. Generating Makefile.

./configure

You may use ``./configure --prefix some_dir'' if you wish to install fookb in
``some_dir'' -- not in ``/usr/local''. Icons will be placed under
``some_dir/share/fookb'', manual page under ``some_dir/man/man1'', fookb
itself under ``some_dir/bin''.

E.g.: ./configure --prefix /usr/local/stow/fookb

2. Fine tuning.

[Read this section only if compilation process was unsuccessful]

configure tries automagically decide: do you wish to compile WindowMaker
dockable version of fookb and would you like use PropList-like configuration
file or X resources for configuring fookb (using libWUtil).

If you have libWUtil AND WINGs/WUtil.h we will try to compile
libWUtil-enabled version of fookb. If you want to compile libWUtil-free
version of fookb, run configure with --disable-libWUtil argument.

If you have wmaker in your $PATH, we will compile WindowMaker dockable verison
of fookb. Run configure with --disable-wmaker to disable this behaviour.

If you have no wmaker in your $PATH you still can compile WindowMaker dockable
version of fookb. Run configure with --enable-wmaker.

3. Compiling

make

If compilation was unsuccessful or you can get no satisfaction, read previous
section.

4. Installing

make install

5. Configuring fookb

IF YOU COMPILED libWUtil-version of fookb:

Copy fookb.cf to ~/GNUstep/Defaults/FOOkb (for Window Maker enabled) or to
~/.fookb (for Window Maker disabled version) and edit this file according to
your desire.

IF YOU COMPILED non-libWUtil version of fookb:

You should put the following resources in your
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/Fookb (or in other file which will be read by
xrdb -- such as ~/.Xresources):

fookb.icon1: xpm_file_with_full_path
fookb.icon2: the same
fookb.icon3: the same
fookb.icon4: the same
fookb.iconBoom: the same
fookb.sound: Yes/No
fookb.command: some_command (for playing sound)

BOTH WAYS:

Instead of putting parameter in config file you may use the following command
line parameters:

-icon1 xpm_file_with_full_path
-icon2 the same
-icon3 the same
-icon4 the same
-iconboom the same

You may also use -display command line parameter.
